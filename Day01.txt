How to make code faster without modification of the Big O complexity?
- Write cache efficient code
- Spatial locality refers to the use of data elements within 
  relatively close storage locations.
- Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data and / or resources 
  within a relatively small time duration.
- Cache friendly code tries to keep accesses close together in memory so that
  you minimize the cache misses.
- Sometime it make sense to split the data into multiple vectors to improve
  the cache efficiency of the code
- Memory pool
